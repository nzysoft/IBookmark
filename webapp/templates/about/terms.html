        Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”). The Services are provided by www.rndsphere.com.
    </p>
    <p>
        By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
        You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method
        other
        than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law,
        including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our
        Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the
        content
        you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are
        otherwise
        permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services.
        Don’t
        remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we
        may
        suspend or stop a Service altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
        We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a
        Service,
        where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of
        that
        Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, WE DO NOT MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT
        THE
        SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC
        FUNCTION OF
        THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES “AS
        IS”.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to
        the
        law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to
        these
        terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not
        apply
        retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes
        addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you
        do
        not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that
        conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
        If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
